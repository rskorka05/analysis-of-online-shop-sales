Sales data analysis – visualisations, statistics, summaries by category, payment method, province and customers

This Python project was developed in Jupyter Notebook for the purpose of sales data analysis.
It was prepared as part of learning data analysis and visualisation in Pandas and Matplotlib.

Project objectives
1. Preliminary preparation and cleaning of data:
   - checking for missing data,
   - date conversion,
   - sorting by time.
2. Creation of new variables:
   - ‘Total_revenue’ column,
   - total revenue by category, payment method, province and customer.
3. Analysis and visualisation:
   - line charts (revenue over time, seasonality),
   - pie charts (share of payment methods),
   - bar charts (revenue by category, province).
4. Interpretation of results:
   - checking sales seasonality,
   - identifying the best and worst selling categories,
   - analysis of payment method popularity.
